# dotfiles

Dotfiles for Bash, command-line and programming tools I use.

## Settings

* `COMPUTER_NAME`: Your computer name
* `Brewfile`: The list of command line tools and apps you would like to install using with `brew` and `cask`
* `locals/bash_local`: Secret stuff you don't want in your versioned dotfiles

## Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:alfakini/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./setup.sh
```
